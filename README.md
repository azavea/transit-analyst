Transit Analyst
========

An interactive tool for exploring transit accessibility to target resources from focus areas.
Based on [otpa-web](https://github.com/bertspaan/otpa-web).

Requires a local OpenTripPlanner instance running on localhost:8080 and a Windshaft tile server running on localhost:4000

The lightly modified version of OpenTripPlanner used for this project is available on the census-analysis branch [here](https://github.com/azavea/OpenTripPlanner).
